# Air-Quality-Analysis

I analyzed the PM 1, 2.5 and 10 concentrations along the Lake Shore Trail from Rogers Park to Uptown in Chicago, Il. Data collection was facilitated using the AirBeam3 portable air sensor to track real-time particulate matter concentrations, temperature, humidity, time of day, and location using longitude and latitude. The goal of this analysis was to understand the relationship between proximity to a highly trafficked road, time of day, and the air quality.

It was found that the air quality was the worst during the morning rush hour, and the best during nighttime. 

There needs to be more comprehensive spatial analysis to understand how proximity to Lake Shore Drive influences the air quality. Due to the nature of the how the data was collected and time constraints, this analysis was not conducted.
